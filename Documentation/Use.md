1. Screen 1: User Search
- Search by 909, email, or First and Last name
- Issues:
- 1. Must type in entire email address, for some reason
- 2. Must type first AND last name

2. Screen 2: Search results
- Lists users who matched search criteria
- Issues: 
- 1. Only really useful when searching by first and last name
- Potential solutions:
- Skip this screen when searching by 909 or email address, or when there is only one result from first/last name
- Would need to be able to go back, just in case

User details:
- Shows all the account information
- Terribly designed, genuinely ridiculous
